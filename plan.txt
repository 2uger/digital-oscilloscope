1. 
    Start with ADC driver to control ADC module and make output as 
    N-bit width register for futher processing.
    Test for this, emulate output of ADC as serial bit flow
2. 
    Simple FIFO with controlling signals to be able to stop writing and resume it

IDEA:
 Testbench for adc driver could read from file, why not to emulate signal as writing values to that file
 from C code, and at the same time we coud write into another file from verilog testbench and read it from
 C code and somehow show up values as plot
